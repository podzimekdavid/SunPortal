# SunPortal

SunPortal is a conceptual microservices-based system designed for monitoring and controlling solar power installations. The system architecture facilitates communication between services using RabbitMQ and Http protocols.

For interaction between the server and client devices, SignalR or HTTP requests are used. The client devices are based on the [UniPi Patron S107-P370](https://www.unipi.technology/cs/unipi-patron-s107-p370), an industrial-grade PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) platform.

SunPortal has been tested with solar inverters and MPPT controllers from Studer, with data acquisition performed through the appropriate protocols.

The entire project was developed in about one week. While it is not perfect or production-ready, I really enjoyed working on it.
